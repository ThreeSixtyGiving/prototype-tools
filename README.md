# Open Philanthropy Standard Tools

This folder will contain tools for generating the various Open Philanthropy standard templates and validators, and converting between Open Philanthropy serialisations. 

## One standard, multiple representations

The Open Philanthropy OWL ontology authoritatively defines the data model.

This will be used to generate:

* A JSON-LD Schema
* A set of CSV templates

It will also provide all the details required for translation of:

* CSV to JSON data
* JSON to CSV
* JSON to Linked Data
