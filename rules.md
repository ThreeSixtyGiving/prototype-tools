## Rules

The following rules are put forward for translating between flat and structured serialisations.

### Roll Ups

Any one-to-one property of an entity related to a table can be placed in that table using the syntax "'Relationship Name' : 'Property Name'". 

### Total Ups

Aggregates values. 

If the value has a currency, then only aggregate in the default currency.
